It is a true top cropping strain with a fruity, very light and softly balanced palate. This strain will finish slightly sweet. London Ale III has become synonymous with the production of New England IPAs, also known as juicy or hazy IPAs, and balances well with the tropical fruit qualities from late and dry hop additions.",
