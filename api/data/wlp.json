Residual sweetness accentuates malt character along with mild fruity esters, adding complexity to the flavor and aroma of finished beers. Slight diacetyl production is common. Due to this strain’s high flocculation, the beer will finish clear and the yeast can easily be harvested from the fermenter for future use. It is common for this yeast to look coagulated.",
